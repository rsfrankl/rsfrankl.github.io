    "text": "Current and Recent Courses:\n\nMapping the City (Newcastle University)\nThis course is designed for final-year undergraduates. It presents the study of cities from a spatial analytic perspective, drawing on theory and concepts from both urban and social geography. Major concepts focus on urban development and change, the socio-demographic fabric of the city, and accessibility and spatial inequality, both within and across cities. These concepts are engaged with through GIS, spatial analytics, and visualization, with the aim of developing enlightened producers and consumers of urban research, policy, and analytics. Specifically, we cover principles of GIS, cartography, and spatial analytics through engagement with the key urban topics identified above.\n\n\nGIS Short Course: Data Visualization and Mapping (GSSI)\nThis short course introduces students to the fundamentals of GIS: locating, importing, and visualizing spatial data, as well as common spatial analysis methods and approaches. Each day’s instruction is organized around short lectures, complemented by hands-on computer activities that provide practice working with the data, the software, and the methods. Students will select a mini-project (progettino!) that allows them to apply the skills they’ve learned, with brief presentations on the final afternoon."

    "text": "I am Professor of Geographical Analysis in the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS) and the School of Geography, Politics and Sociology at Newcastle University and the Group Leader for Liveability in the Science of Cities and Regions Programme at the Alan Turing Institute. In addition, I am the academic lead for Newcastle at the Turing Institute and a former Fellow. Alongside these roles, I am the Head of Newcastle Data, one of the University’s centres of research excellence and the focal point for managing our strategic priority in data, data science, and AI. I was recruited to Newcastle in 2018 to help expand our international, cross-disciplinary reputation in Spatial Analytics and Modeling.\nMy primary research focus is in spatial demography and the interplay between spatial analytics and demographic change, in particular quantifying patterns, sources and impacts of spatial inequality. Current and recent projects, for example, study “Left Behind” places, the ways in which smart city infrastructures can reinforce existing inequalities, and the role of spatial scale and context in understanding the manifestation and impacts of depopulation across neighborhoods, cities, and regions. I also maintain an ongoing interest in pedagogy, especially the teaching of methods. I have taught spatial analysis, GIS, and quantitative methods for almost 20 years, with a pedagogic orientation towards policy applications and the social sciences and humanities. I am co-editor of a recent Elgar Handbook of Spatial Analysis in the Social Sciences, with Serge Rey, and co-author of a textbook aimed at teaching GIS for the social sciences.\nI am the current editor of the journal, Geographical Analysis, co-editor of Spatial Economic Analysis, previous book review editor of the Journal of Regional Science, and a member of the editorial boards of several journals, including Population, Space and Place, Annals of the American Association of Geographers (AAG), Journal of Regional Science, Journal of Geographical Systems (and lots more). For eight years (2010–2018) I was the Associate Director of the Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4) initiative at Brown University in the U.S. and also held an academic appointment in Population Studies. Other professional experience includes the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Association of Geographers (AAG).\nI do other stuff too. With Daniel Arribas-Bel and Levi Wolf, I am the co-host of the GLaD Podcast – Geography, Life and Data – supported by the Science of Cities and Regions Programme at the Alan Turing Institute. The podcast is an outgrowth of our pandemic-era Spatial Analytics + Data (SAD) seminar and interview series. I also have a newsletter, which tends to be equal parts professional and personal.\nI received my PhD in Geography from the University of Arizona (2004). My previous degrees are from Indiana University: BA in French and Political Science and MA in West European Studies."

    "text": "I am a population geographer with research interests in the sources and impacts of demographic change as it occurs at multiple spatial scales. Demography — age structure, migration patterns, or human capital stocks, for example — is at the core of most social science, health, or environmental challenges facing us. I work at the regional and local scales to understand how best to characterize or measure the populations of places; how location and scale are related to demographic change; and how migration, especially internal, affects demographic composition. I am especially interested in how we use data and statistics to understand what sorts of people are located where, how this changes over time, and what this means for our understanding of spatial inequality.\n\nData\nData is the cornerstone of demographic and spatial research. Whether traditional (e.g., census or survey) or new and emerging (e.g., trajectory or sensor), we rely on data to characterise society, understand how it is evolving, and identify social and spatial inequalities. It is therefore imperative to understand our data: sources, characteristics, and attendant strengths and weaknesses. I’ve written about data here and here. I also head up the ESRC Smart Data Research UK (SDR UK) Strategic Advice Team, providing expert knowledge and insight to the ESRC on their £49 million investment into smart data infrastructure and services.\n\n\nSpatial Inequality and the Smart City\nSmart city technologies, particularly sensors, contribute to and reinforce socio-economic and spatial inequalities. Funded by the Alan Turing Institute, this project aims to identify who is affected by ‘sensor deserts’, ascertain coverage for vulnerable populations, and improve understanding of connections between urban mobility and sensor density and location. This work contributes to a growing body of research that highlights the potential risk of smart cities increasing rather than reducing inequality and quality of life, providing a blueprint to assist cities in better adoption of smart city technologies.\n\n\nLeft Behind Places, Shrinking Cities, and Depopulation\nRecent and ongoing projects address spatial inequality from a landscape perspective: how do we identify, locate, and measure places that are failing to thrive? I have been particularly interested in population loss or shrinkage at the local and regional scales in the United States, with research projects that have focused on the ways in which the degree of loss in any one time period may be mediated or exacerbated by the larger geographical and historical context; the demographic sources of population loss; spatial metrics for urban shrinkage; and the impacts of loss on inequality. These projects have been funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health in the United States. Other research focuses on the measurement of human capital stocks and the relationship between migration and human capital, including research on university student migration flows in the United States. Most recently, as part of a multinational team, funded by the ESRC in the UK, this research has expanded to include multidimensional perspectives on “Left Behind” neighbourhoods and regions.\n\n\nRecent and Currently-Funded Projects\n“The SDR UK Imagery Data Service for Sustainability, Prosperity and Wellbeing (Imago),” U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), September 2024–March 2029 (Co-Director with Dani Arribas-Bel, £5,430,913)\n“Digital Footprints: Strategic Advice Team,” U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), January 2023–December 2024 (PI, £521,228)\n“Estimating Pandemic Effects on Publication in Regional Studies Journals,” Regional Studies Association, April–September, 2022 (PI, £28,991)\n“Beyond ‘Left Behind Places’: Understanding Demographic and Socioeconomic Change in Peripheral Regions,” U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), January 1, 2021–December 31, 2023 (Co-I; £563,618)\n“The Impact of the Environment and Pollution on Cognitive Health (EPOCH): Building the knowledge base through international collaboration,” U.K. Medical Research Council (MRC), October 1, 2020–September 30, 2023 (Co-I; £538,704)\n“Centre for Doctoral Training in Geospatial Systems,” U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), April 1, 2019–September 30, 2027 (Co-I; £6,718,389)\n“Smart Cities and Inequality,” Alan Turing Institute, October 1, 2018–March 31, 2022 (PI; £268,023)"
